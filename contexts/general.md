# About FINSA

FINSA (Finance Students' Association) is a student-run organization dedicated to finance education.
We host events, workshops, speaker panels, and competitions throughout the year.
Our goal is to bridge the gap between academic finance and the real industry.
Membership is open to all students interested in finance.
