# Bull's Cage

Bull's Cage is FINSA's flagship stock pitch competition.
Teams of 2-4 students research and pitch a public equity investment to a panel of industry judges.
It is held annually in the winter semester.
It is a great way to practice valuation, financial modelling, and presentation skills.
Past winners have gone on to internships at top investment banks.
